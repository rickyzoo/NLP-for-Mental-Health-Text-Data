# NLP-for-Mental-Health-Text-Data

This project was completed as part of the Digital Practice & Inquiry (DIDA425) capstone project course for the Digital & Data Studies minor at SUNY Binghamton. I used this opportunity to introduce myself and learn about Natural Language Processing (NLP) and dealing with text data, along with working with a transformer language model (Microsoft's DeBerTa v3 small model). All relevant information can be found in the Jupyter Notebook file.

I used various Natural Language Processing techniques to analyze a text-heavy dataset centered around mental health concerns.
